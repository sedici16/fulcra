This project focuses on predicting blood glucose levels (Low, Normal, High) using machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost. It integrates and processes health metrics datasets, handling missing data and class imbalances. Key dietary and activity-related features are analyzed for their influence on glucose levels. The workflow includes feature importance analysis, data visualization, and recommendations to enhance model accuracy. Addressing challenges like data imbalance and redundancy, this project provides actionable insights into glucose prediction while emphasizing the impact of dietary and lifestyle factors. Ideal for exploring data science techniques and improving health-related predictive models with imbalanced datasets.
