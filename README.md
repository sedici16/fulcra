# Predicting Blood Glucose Levels with Machine Learning

This project explores the prediction of blood glucose levels (**Low, Normal, High**) using advanced machine learning techniques like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. It integrates multiple health metrics datasets, processes missing data, and addresses class imbalance to achieve accurate classification.

## Key Features

### Data Handling
- Combines multiple health datasets.
- Interpolates missing values and resolves feature redundancies.

### Feature Analysis
- Evaluates dietary and lifestyle factors.
- Identifies key contributors like protein, carbohydrates, and fiber consumption.

### Machine Learning Models
- Implements **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
- Compares performance metrics to optimize model accuracy.

### Visualization
- Includes confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and performance metrics.

## Challenges Addressed
- Tackles **class imbalance** using oversampling and synthetic data generation techniques.
- Resolves dataset inconsistencies and missing data for robust predictions.

## Highlights
- Provides actionable insights into glucose regulation, emphasizing dietary and activity-related impacts.
- Serves as a practical case study for handling imbalanced datasets and building predictive health models.
