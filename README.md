Predicting Blood Glucose Levels with Machine Learning
This project explores the prediction of blood glucose levels (Low, Normal, High) using machine learning techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost. It integrates multiple health metrics datasets, processes missing data, and addresses class imbalance for accurate classification.

Key Features:
Data Handling: Combines health datasets, interpolates missing values, and resolves feature redundancies.
Feature Analysis: Evaluates dietary and lifestyle factors, identifying key contributors like protein, carbohydrates, and fiber consumption.
Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest and XGBoost, comparing performance metrics to optimize accuracy.
Visualization: Confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and performance metrics.
Challenges Addressed:
Tackles class imbalance by exploring oversampling and synthetic data generation techniques.
Manages dataset inconsistencies and missing data to ensure robust predictions.
Highlights:
This project provides actionable insights into glucose regulation, emphasizing dietary and activity-related impacts. It serves as a practical case study in handling imbalanced datasets and building predictive health models.
